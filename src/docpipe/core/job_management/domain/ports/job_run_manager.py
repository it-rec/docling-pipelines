    """
    Port interface for pluggable job execution frameworks.

    Users can implement this interface to integrate their own job execution systems.
    The framework handles job lifecycle management: creation, monitoring, cancellation,
    and deletion.

    Default Implementation:
    - DefaultJobRunManager: Internal execution using JobTracker

    Custom Implementation Examples (User's Choice):
    - KubernetesJobRunManager: Execute jobs in Kubernetes pods
    - CeleryJobRunManager: Distribute jobs via Celery task queue
    - AirflowJobRunManager: Trigger Airflow DAGs
    - BatchJobRunManager: Submit to AWS Batch or similar

    Responsibilities:
    - Create job run records in your execution system
    - Retrieve job run information and status
    - Update job run status (for async/external executors)
    - Cancel running jobs
    - Delete job run records

    #: from ``job_run_stats``. Aggregating them requires reading every node-stats
    #: record of the run, so callers only include them for adapters that declare
    #: they need them. Defaults to True so custom adapters keep receiving them.
