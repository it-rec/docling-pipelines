## Sample Data

Notebooks use existing sample data from the repository:

- **Documents**: `sample_documents/` - Text files for testing
- **Invoices**: `tests/fixtures/invoices/` - PDF invoices for extraction
- **Purchase Orders**: `tests/fixtures/purchase_orders/` - Sample POs
- **Customer Support**: `tests/fixtures/customer_support_docs/` - Support documents

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

```
ImportError: No module named 'docpipe'
```

**Solution**: Set PYTHONPATH correctly
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/src:${PYTHONPATH}"
```

### Connection Errors

```
ConnectionError: Failed to connect to Ollama
```

**Solution**: Start Ollama and pull models
```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### Kernel Issues

```
Kernel not found
```

**Solution**: Install ipykernel in your environment
```bash
uv sync --extra notebooks
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=docpipe
```

## Tips for Using Notebooks

1. **Run cells sequentially** - Notebooks are designed to be executed top-to-bottom
2. **Check prerequisites** - Each notebook has a prerequisites check cell
3. **Restart kernel if needed** - Use "Kernel → Restart & Run All" to start fresh
4. **Save outputs** - Notebooks with outputs are useful for reference
5. **Experiment** - Modify parameters and re-run cells to learn
