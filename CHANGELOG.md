## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/integrations/openlineage/OPENLINEAGE_GUIDE.md` — new integration guide covering OpenLineage support: installation, enabling, configuration reference (all env vars, HTTP and File transport), emission modes (flow vs operator), Marquez integration and architecture, event catalog by mode, custom facets reference, and a step-by-step guide for adding a custom lineage client.
- React frontend UI with Elyra-based pipeline canvas, per-operator properties panels, project/flow management, and Node.js BFF layer; bundled into the wheel and served at `/ui/` (#58)
- `StorageOutputOperator` — writes processed documents to a configurable destination with `processed_content`, `refetch_original`, and `comprehensive_export` modes (#58)
- `S3DestinationAdapter` — writes to S3 / IBM COS / MinIO with env-var credentials and bucket pre-flight validation (#58)
- `SharePointDestinationAdapter` — writes to SharePoint document libraries via Microsoft Graph API (#58)
- `GoogleDriveDestinationAdapter` — writes to Google Drive with resumable uploads and Service Account / OAuth2 auth (#58)
- `onedrive` provider alias for `SharePointDestinationAdapter` (#58)
- `ibm_cos` provider alias for `S3DestinationAdapter` (#58)
- Hierarchical multi-source path namespacing when `ingest_source` is configured with multiple `paths` (#58)
- Dropbox ingest source adapter with OAuth2 auth, cursor pagination, and extension/size filters (#44)
- Milvus Lite support (`auth_type: "lite"`) for container-free local vector storage in `VectorDBOperator` (#56)
- Full OCR engine exposure — `ocr.engine`, `ocr.mode`, `ocr.enabled`, and `ocr.engine_options` in `ExtractOperator` provider config (#58)
- GPU acceleration for `ExtractOperator` via `standard_pipeline.accelerator` in `provider_config` (#58)
- HashiCorp Vault integration — `vault://` URI scheme for resolving secrets in flow configs at runtime (#58)
- `docling-pipelines-slim` package variant excluding heavyweight operator dependencies (#58)
- Comprehensive Vitest unit test suite for the frontend (149 files, 2155+ tests) (#81)
- Flow execution defaults `enable_micro_batching` to `true` when not set in the flow (#58)
- OpenLineage dependencies, domain models, and port interfaces (#62)
- Deprecation policy (`docs/guides/DEPRECATION_POLICY.md`) and migration guide template (#58)
- Release process documentation (`RELEASE_PROCESS.md`) (#58)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `IngestSourceOperator` migrated from `connection_params` + `credentials` to unified `provider_config`; all 8 source adapters and all sample flows updated (#152)
- `PIIAndHAPAnnotator` provider selection replaced with decorator-based `PIIAndHAPDetectionFactory` registry (#76)
- 33 self-free instance methods converted to `@staticmethod` across `FlowValidator`, `AuthoringCompiler`, `FlowExecutionReporter`, `MetadataAggregator`, and `IncrementalUpdateService` (#139)
- 18 self-free per-document hot-path methods converted to `@staticmethod` across `ReadabilityMetrics`, `JobReportGenerator`, `EmbeddingsOperator`, and `DuckDBTableStorage` (#139)

### Fixed

- Empty `vlm_pipeline` and `asr_pipeline` objects enable their respective pipelines with defaults; omitted or `null` blocks keep them disabled. The default VLM preset is `granite_docling` (#123).
- Storage output now accepts cloud destination credentials and S3 `key_prefix` saved by the UI, while retaining support for the separate `credentials` field and legacy S3 `prefix`, and reads ingest source paths from the normalized `provider_config`.
- Updated JupyterLab to 4.6.4 in the full and slim notebooks extras to resolve the security alerts tracked in #51.
- Notification panel now propagates `action_type` from backend validation and fixes stale alert detection (#91)
- Markdown chunking: send extracted content with `.md` filename to preserve source name in chunk metadata (#148)
- Job runs list response now populates the actual flow name instead of a blank value (#118)
- VectorDB enrichment: hydrate connection defaults into `provider_config` before API call (#80)
- Milvus auth fields, advanced JSON validation, and SSL default corrected in the frontend (#80)
- Frontend wheel build is now mandatory; UI included in the distributed package (#125)
- `PII and HAP` operator validates `provider_config` and `model_id` during flow validation (#105)
- Node execution logs aligned with DAG pipeline order; active duration calculation fixed (#107)
- `scripts/test_examples.py --dry-run` skips prerequisites before probing Ollama or environment (#31)
- S3 benchmark flows use configured prefix and `max_files` without embedding a corpus-wide exclusion list

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **`docling-pipelines-api` console command** — The entry point previously pointed at the FastAPI `app` object (`docpipe.api.main:app`), causing a `TypeError` on invocation. A `run()` launcher function has been added to `src/docpipe/api/main.py` and `pyproject.toml` now registers `docpipe.api.main:run` as the entry point. Running `docling-pipelines-api` now correctly starts a Uvicorn server on `127.0.0.1:8080`.

- **Ruff PTH123 compliance** — Replaced `open()` calls with `Path.open()` across the codebase.

### Changed

- Bumped vulnerable dependencies flagged by Dependabot.
